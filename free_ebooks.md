There are ton ton of free articles and e-books at

https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-programming-books.md

Sections I recommend you browse though:

C#, because we may have a breakoff group start working with Unity

C++, because a lot of our members are in C++ courses.

Emacs (specifically the GNU Emacs Manual), because emacs can be confusing.

Language Agnostic - most of it, honestly, but in particular:
	Algorithms and Datastructures
	Database
	Machine learning
	Mathematics
	Parallel programming
	Regular expressions
	
Linux, because a lot of us will end up working with it.

Python, because we use it nearly exlcusively in our society. Make sure to learn Python 3.

SQL (Implementatin agnostic), because SQL is implemented in NEO. Also, at some point, you may want to interact with a database.
