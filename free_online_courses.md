***************************************************************
There are several programming-related free courses at:

https://github.com/EbookFoundation/free-programming-books/blob/master/free-courses-en.md

My personal suggestions are similar to what I wrote in free_ebooks.md, but I'll outline it here, too.

Algorithms and Data Structures

C# (Not super important, but we may start working with Unity)

C++

Deep Learning

Machine Learning

Misc - has several AI-related courses

Python - again, make sure you learn Python 3

The ones that I believe relate most closely to this society are:

Computer science: These courses are not meant to scare anyone away, and it's certainly not necessary to watch all (or any) of these, but all of them will contain very useful information for you if you continue in a programming-related field.

	6.0001: Intro to Computer Science and Programming in Python
	6.0002: Intro to Computational Thinking and Data Science
	6.006: Intro to Algorithms
	6.034: Artificial Intelligence
	6.851: Advanced Data Structures

Mathematics: Just like the CS courses above, I don't want to scare anyone away. I simply list them here because they will help build a foundation where you can better understand various machine learning algorithms.

	18.01: Single-variable calculus
	18.02: Multivariable calculus
	18.06: Linear Algebra
	18.650: Statistics for Applications
