Links to useful libraries and articles related to Machine Learning

# SciKit Learn
[SciKit Learn is a Python library used for machine learning.](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)</br>
The library contains incredibly useful tools for [working with beginner data sets](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.datasets)
and experimenting with different types of machine learning models including neural networks.

[Here is a tutorial for getting familiar with some features of the library](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/index.html)

# Pandas
[Pandas is another Python library that is used to analyze and format your data for working with ML models.](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
It is really useful for formatting data sets from CVS, text, and even excel files.</br>
